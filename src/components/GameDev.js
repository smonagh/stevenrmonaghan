          <p> A recent hobby and side project that I have been working is my upcoming game
              Doctor Xenophons Laboratory. It is a 3D puzzle/platformer that takes the player
              through the dark and mysterious place that is the doctors laboratory. Led along by
              the laboratories untrustworthy operating system, Alpha-Omega, the player must solve puzzles
              traverse the laboratories moving platforms and traps to get to the Doctor.

              A small clip of a prototype level that I built can be found here.
